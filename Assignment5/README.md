Description
This project is a social network-based music recommendation system.
It uses custom data structures and algorithms to analyze user data and provide music artist recommendations.

Data Structures
HashMap: provides a basic hash table implementation for mapping keys to values.
Set: used to store unique IDs in the User class, ensuring uniqueness.
Vectors: used to sort and ordered data management.

Algorithms
Sorting: listen counts and sort artists based on popularity. Sorting identifies the most popular artists.
Depth-First search: traverse social networks or relationships.

Design Choice
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of data structures like HashMaps, and how to apply algorithms effectively in a real-world application. The experience improved my problem-solving skills, especially in handling large datasets and developing a system that is both efficient and easy to understand.
